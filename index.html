          <h1>Buchii ICT Company</h1>
          <p class="pin">Providing Quality ICT Service</p>

          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>The Internet has opened up numerous opportunities for companies to communicate with prospects, customers, staff, and other interested stakeholders.<br>
             In addition to communication, web sites provide a simple and easy tool through which companies can increase access to their products and services beyond the “normal” geographical constraints.</p>
          <p>Buchii Services is a small start-up firm located in Awka, Nigeria. We offer Internet and Web-related services to small businesses, schools and individuals in Nigeria and we are making plans to penetrate foreign markets. The services we offer include website development and design, hosting, maintenance, marketing, application development, software development, social media marketing and analysis, ICT training, among other internet/ICT related services.
             Given our experience and expertise in both commercial Web development and business-to-business sales, we believe we can offer a unique and superior service to small business owners and corporate organization in comparison to what is currently available.
             The demand and growth rate for Web development and marketing services, mobile application development, web and social media marketing in the small business market is at an all-time high and shows no sign of slowing anytime soon. Even more astonishing is the fact that very few Web development companies have taken advantage of the opportunity, as there are no dominating participants in this huge market.
             We believe the reason for this virtually untapped market is due to ignorance of the opportunities internet as provided, expensive project costs, the highest profit margins in Web development today are in servicing large- and medium-sized corporations. We have developed a system that dramatically reduces steep project costs and henceforth will allow us to offer the same high-end Web development services and training services as larger companies receive at a much lower cost to the client.<br>
             This business plan will highlight many aspects of our system, products we have developed and those products in pipeline and our businesses. It will detail market growth and demand, and it will outline our projected cash flow and profit margins over the next three years. All numbers regarding our projected company growth are based on previous information gathered by activity in the company and market trends over the last few months of operation.</p>

          <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
          <p>Our mission is to provide affordable, accessible, and streamlined Internet and Web services to small businesses. We have developed a system for offering many different types of Web services (site development, hosting, marketing, and maintenance, training) that are exclusively tailored to fit the needs and resources of small companies, corporate organisations and individuals.</p>

          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <p>
            It is given that technology and keeping up with new innovations strongly influence our business. We operate a Windows® based Local Area Network (LAN) in the office that is equipped with the most current software and hardware tools available to meet our project requirements. Within the next year, we will be investing in additional tools that will extend our capabilities in handling various types of program files (i.e. Macintosh computers, large capacity data storage, and high-end image scanners). We also have plans to purchase licensing agreements with our major software vendors to allow for automatic upgrades in new software tools.<br>
            We are planning to own and operate both a professional digital and film camera for the purpose of offering on-site and in-house product and business photography to our clients. We would like to improve upon these services in the near future by purchasing a more complete photography system, it has been our experience that this is a service many small businesses are recognizing as a crucial part of their online marketing efforts and would take advantage of it were we to offer such a service.
          </p>

          <h4>Market Needs</h4>

            <p>
              The need for small businesses Internet services has existed for several years. Small businesses and start-up businesses alike are migrating onto the Web at an astonishing rate and making their online presence a higher priority than in earlier years. We have noticed an enormous hole however in the small business services that are currently available.<br>
              Without a doubt, there is a need for custom, high-end, dynamic services designed exclusively for small businesses. At this point, the majority of our competitors are offering services tailored around big business, to small business owners, or they are offering the exact opposite, one-dimensional, "cookie cutter" type services.<br>
              While every small business has now recognized the need for having a presence on the Internet, many do not know where to start, how much it will cost, or even how it will benefit their company. It has been our experience by talking to small business owners that the decision to take advantage of the Web is not a matter of 'if' but a matter of 'when.'
