          </h1>

          <h4>Strategy and Implementation</h4>
          <p>
            Buchii Services will initially focus all marketing and sales efforts toward the education sector, real estate, fashion and small businesses. We will market ourselves as an Internet and Web services organization devoted to offering high-end services to small businesses exclusively. Our target customer will be the owners of any small or home-based company who are looking to implement their business into the Web.<br>
            We will seek out small companies looking to develop an Internet presence for the first time. We will market our services to small business owners as a "step-by-step" process, initially starting out with a small, simple website, then gradually improving and adding to the site and their entire online marketing efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we plan to bring on many clients who simply will need an online presence and nothing more, our most important and sought after clients will be those business owners who are ready to implement a larger percentage of their company onto the Internet. This type of client will traditionally need one of the following services:
            <ul>
              <li>E-commerce/shopping cart.</li>
              <li>Database driven websites.</li>
              <li>Dynamic content and website features.</li>
              <li>Aggressive online website marketing.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>Pricing Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            For most small business owners, cost&mdash;both residual and one&ndash;time are huge influences on the decisions they make regarding everyday operations of their company. Even though we offer 100% customized services, our pricing is based on an hourly fee. To make it easier and less confusing for our clients, we have established a packaged pricing system.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Small Business Website Package</strong> (N50,000): For simple, information based websites. Popular with companies who just need to gain an Internet presence.</li>
              <li><strong>Mid-Level Website Package</strong> (N100,000): Information based websites with a large amount of content. Popular with companies that have a large services/products list and/or want to implement more of their business into the Web.</li>
              <li><strong>Ecommerce</strong> (N200,000): Usually reserved for product-oriented websites that are e-commerce enabled. Popular with companies that have a desire to market heavily on the Internet or sell their products/services directly from the Web.</li>
              <li><strong>Website Hosting</strong> (from N4000 to N15,000 per month): Depending on the type and size of the website, the price for hosting can vary greatly. The average cost of hosting for most clients is n5000 per month.</li>
              <li><strong>Website Maintenance</strong> (N2,000 per hour): We charge a set fee of N2000 per hour billed in 10 minute increments. If a client feels as though they will need their website updated or maintained on a regular basis, packages are available at a discount rate.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>Sales Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            Our clients are small business owners, most are very protective of their company, and almost all of them are salesmen themselves. We sell value, service, and quality when we talk to business owners. We need to convince them that they can look past all of the hype surrounding the Internet and still see why having a website is worth the money spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We currently utilize a database system specifically targeted toward our desired demographic to establish our first contact with every potential client. It has proven a successful method for soliciting new business directly due to the method in which we approach the first call. The salesman always requests to speak to the business owner, asking for him by his first name only, and when asked who is calling, responds by providing simply his first name as well. Once on the phone with the business owner, there is absolutely no script and the salesman clearly identifies himself and asks the business owner if he has ever considered having a website developed for his company, no matter what the response, a brief conversation will always pursue, sometimes leading to an appointment, and sometimes to a follow-up call.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we have full confidence in our services, and recognize that business owners are generally open to the idea of utilizing the Internet and most even consider it a necessity, we take a very low-pressure, non-abrasive approach to direct selling. We will normally present the information about our company, portfolio, strengths, and pricing to the client and let them make the decision on their own. This method has proven successful provided that we keep our follow-up calls consistent and regular until we receive either a yes or no answer.
          </p>

          <h4>Strategy Alliance</h4>
          <p>
            Currently, we do not participate in any co-marketing or co-development efforts with outside companies. However, we have specific plans to establish several strategic partnership programs with area ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and computer consulting companies. These partnerships are intended to attract more sub-contracting work from potential competitors, in exchange for a commission to be paid for each lead and resulting new client.
          </p>

          <h4>Promotion Strategy</h4>
          <p>Our target client is part of a very specific demographic, for this reason, we market and promote our services in a direct and specifically targeted manner.</p>
          <h6>Direct Mail</h6>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>We have sent out targeted bulk mail flyers promoting special offerings by our company.</li>
              <li>We have participated in targeted broadcast fax promotions to small businesses in our area.</li>
              <li>In the near future we will begin a new aggressive, ongoing bulk mail campaign to promote our Web development and hosting services.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h6>Mass Media Ads</h6>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>We will begin advertising on a broader scale within the next six months. Radio spots will be continuously played during local area talk shows and news programs, this placement is intended to reach the highest percentage of our target client possible.</li>
              <li>Billboard ad placement will be the second mass media marketing campaign we will implement into our marketing efforts. Billboard ads will be intended as 'name recognition' advertising.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h6>Educational Seminars</h6>
          <p>
