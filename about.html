          <h4>Company Summary</h4>
          <p>
            Buchii Services was born out of the needs to provide quality and low cost web development, help small businesses increase sales through online and bring high return on investment (ROI) to small businesses and corporate organizations that are yet to tap this enormous opportunity that internet has provided.<br>
            The company was founded in January 2016 and commenced operation in late September, 2016. Registered with Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria (under Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990, pursuant to section 659), with registration number of BN 12345c78.<br>
            We started from home as a freelancer and a tech start-up at 13, Zik Avenue, Awka, Anambra State, due to high cost of renting an office, maintenance, equipment and also due to lack of enough capital to rent such a befitting space.
          </p>

          <p>
            The studio has a professionally configured office environment and includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Dedicated phone line</li>
              <li>Broadband Internet access</li>
              <li>2 Laptops, and 4 Desktop Computers</li>
              <li>Laser printer</li>
              <li>Web designing software</li>
              <li>Graphics and Content Management softwares</li>
            </ul>
            Significant intellectual property, along with the range of business contacts the owners have, also constitutes part of the company’s assets.

              For the website design, development, marketing, analysis, and maintenance we will employ industry professionals to handle our clients' needs. Working for the company presently is Okonkwo Godspower, a professional website development engineer and strategist with over four years of experience in the commercial Web development industry. To keep employee costs low, we have designed a "team" development system that will consist of two full-time sales people, three full-time fullstack developers, and a CTO. They will all work in teams and will be supervised by a team leader, who in turn reports to the CTO. However, the senior developers will have the duty of maintaining the same high quality level of work in the junior developers' projects, that our clients have learned to expect from us now.

Forming the alliances has allowed us much flexibility in important hosting features, customizability, and it has drove costs down dramatically. All these benefits are crucial to preserving the integrity of our company as being a 'fully-rounded Internet solutions provider' for small businesses.
