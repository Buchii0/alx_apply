          <h4>Services Description</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Website Design and Development:</strong> The service that we offer to small businesses, corporate organisations and individuals helping them create online presence to engage their customers positively, increase sales and also create exposure and return on investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Website Marketing and Social Media:</strong> After we build the website for our client, or a new client introduces us to their pre-existing site, we offer this service. As experts of the Web, we can analyze and test a website based on an established set of standards that account for the website's aesthetic value, scalability, functionality, ease-of-use, and main customer base. After an analysis has been made, we then explore and present to the client a detailed list of the most efficient Internet marketing tools and methods available to them within the constraints of their budget. This type of service is pertinent to our company given the fact that a very large percentage of our clients are on a tight budget and can only afford to take advantage of marketing efforts that are targeted directly at their desired demographic.<br>
            There are over 4,076,160 Nigerians on Facebook and over 8,000,000 on other social network. We help to promote products and services of businesses to these Nigerians on social networks.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Website Hosting and Maintenance:</strong> This service is offered for two reasons. The first reason is because they are both ongoing, continual services that we can use to establish and maintain a strong residual income. The second reason for offering these services is to allow for packaging together with other services either Utibe Servicess offers, or services an outside company can provide, hence allowing us to expand our range of small business Internet services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>ICT Training:</strong> Information and communication technology has changed the way we do business today and so many individuals without ICT skills now understand the important of acquiring these skills to position themselves for better opportunities. We will provide training in the following categories: web design/development, graphic design, desktop publishing and other professional courses like CCNA, MCSE to mention just a few.
          </p>

          <h4>Promotion</h4>
          <p>
            Buchii Services currently distributes a sales folder with all the pertinent information about our company and services. This folder includes our strong points, history, portfolio examples, and pricing packages info.  It also contains facts based on the growth and popularity of the Internet for small businesses. We have also design and printed flyers about our latest training programmes and we have paid agent to help us distribute the flyers.<br>
            We currently operates and maintains a fully-functioning website that provides information about the company, plus a variety of helpful resources for small business owners which we will be constantly updating. In the next six months, we plan to produce and distribute bulk mail and flyers promoting our web development and hosting services to small businesses.
            We have plans to offer a more compact version of our main sales folder in a brochure format. This brochure will be available both as a mail to interested parties and as a sales solicitation in other businesses.
          </p>

          <h4>Future Services</h4>
          <p>
            We plan to provide more services to our highly esteemed users in the nearest future. Below are brief details of the services that we would venture into.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Local Area Network Installation:</strong> These days, a quickly increasing number of small businesses are using computers as a necessary tool in the everyday operations of the company. We would like to be able to expand our current services to meet this new demand. We will handle every aspect of setting up a small business with an internal network of computers from purchasing, installing, and configuring the machines to software integration and educating the employees on proper usage and operating functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Intranet Setup Installation:</strong> In our plan, after developing an Internet website for outside marketing purposes, we would like to offer the service of implementing the website into the network for use in all the business day-to-day operations. This would include extensive product/service cataloging, vital employee and management information, sharing of accounting and inventory details, etc., all intended for strictly company uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Internet Access for Small Business:</strong> This feature would act as another residual, packageable service. We would target small businesses exclusively allowing us to provide more flexibility and affordability to our clients through discounted high volume rates, value added service packages, and much more aggressive technical support services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Result-based Marketing:</strong> This is a service that no small business can turn down. We have plans to offer aggressive, intensified marketing services with the fees based solely on results. To achieve this, we are in the process of forming multiple partnerships and alliances with industry specific Internet websites and various other software and service-oriented companies that provide specific marketing services and tools based on results achieved. We feel as though offering this rare service will dramatically increase our portfolio of clients.
          </p>
          <p>Other areas the company will like to tap into are value added services for telecom providers, provision of training facilities and training programme to small business and corporate organization, take ICT contract from organizations and individuals among others.</p>
